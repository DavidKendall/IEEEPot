\begin{abstract}
  In the practical study of cybersecurity, students benefit greatly from having
  full control of physical equipment and services. However, this presents far
  too great a risk to security to be permitted on university campus networks.
  This paper describes an approach, used successfully at Northumbria
  University, in which students have control of an off-campus network
  laboratory, with a dedicated connection to the Internet.  The laboratory is
  flexible enough to allow the teaching of general purpose networking and
  operating systems courses, while also supporting the teaching of
  cybersecurity through the safe integration of honeypot devices. In addition,
  the paper gives an analysis of honeypot architectures and presents two in
  detail. One of these offers students the opportunity to study cybersecurity
  attacks and defences at very low cost.  It has been developed as a
  stand-alone device that also can be integrated safely into the laboratory
  environment for the study of more complex scenarios.  The main contributions
  of this paper are the design and implementation of: an off-campus, physical
  network laboratory; a small, low-cost, configurable platform for use as a
  ``light-weight'' honeypot; and a laboratory-based, multi-user honeypot for
  large-scale, concurrent, cybersecurity experiments.  The paper outlines how
  the laboratory environment has been successfully deployed within a university
  setting to support the teaching and learning of cybersecurity. It highlights
  the type of experiments and projects that have been supported and can be
  supported in the future.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
When teaching cybersecurity in an academic environment, there are many
considerations that need to be taken into account, not least respect for
users' privacy and their access to learning and teaching facilities.
Cybersecurity experiments can result in traffic or services being deployed
into the network of the teaching environment in ways that may affect other
users, for example, through service depletion, traffic
redirection~\cite{ACGO:06,LR:06}, or unauthorised data capture. In the most
serious cases, the legal rights of other users may be violated.
For these reasons, there are restrictions on the network activities that are
permitted on a typical university campus network, designed for general
student access. For example, port security may be employed to prevent the
attachment of unauthorised equipment to the network, or firewalls may be used
to restrict outgoing / incoming traffic from the Internet. Quite rightly,
students are not allowed administrative privileges to configure the computers
and other devices attached to the main campus network.

It is clear that these restrictions severely limit the kind of work that can be
undertaken in teaching real-world, practical cybersecurity skills, and the
access to potentially useful teaching resources~\cite{ACGO:06,YYLCHJ:04} that
can be made available to students. They also prevent the control over the
network that is required for the effects of attacks to be isolated and analysed
thoroughly. For example, in order to analyse the effects of an attack on the
throughput of a protocol, it may be necessary to restrict other network
activity, such as file transfers or service advertising that may impact on the
experimental environment and invalidate the results. This is not possible on a
main campus network.

These issues highlight the need for a clear specification of the requirements
of a specialist network environment for the study of cybersecurity. This is one of the
key topics of this paper.

Another key topic is the role that can be played by \emph{honeypots} in
providing a stimulating environment for students to study practical aspects of
cybersecurity.  Honeypots are computer systems designed specifically for
cybersecurity investigations~\cite{FKAS:17,BCF:12}.  They exist in a variety of
forms, e.g. as a ``lab-in-a-box'' (\texttt{LiaB})~\cite{CFDMH:09}; as a full
network deployment, incorporating switches, routers, and servers; as a simple
program running on a computer, or as a virtualised platform. 
We classify honeypots in terms of the level of interaction and analysis that
they offer, and also in terms of the volume of concurrent requests that they
are able to process.

\begin{itemize}

  \item \noindent \textit{\textbf{Low Interaction:}} Implements coarse-grained
    services and captures only a low-level of detail about their implementation
    and their interaction with users.  This type of honeypot can also be used
    to act as an attractor for bot-based attacks~\cite{SZB:16}.  

  \item \noindent \textit{\textbf{High Interaction:}} Implements fine-grained
    services and captures a high-level of detail about their implementation and
    their interaction with users.  This type of honeypot is called a
    ``research'' honeypot by Mairh et al.~\cite{MBVJ:11}. High-interaction
    honeypots can also be used to distract potential hackers from a genuine
    system (a decoy)~\cite{M:06,SNKA:12}.

\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}

  \item \noindent \textit{\textbf{Low Volume:}} Capable of supporting only a
    small number of concurrent requests.  This type honeypot is often deployed
    in a research or teaching laboratory to investigate the details of a single
    attack type.

  \item \noindent \textit{\textbf{High Volume:}} Capable of supporting a large
    number of concurrent requests. This type of honeypot is often deployed in
    an environment that results in the honeypot being subjected to high levels
    of usage from multiple sources. 

\end{itemize}

These two categories provide four different types of honeypot based upon
interaction and volume. We use the obvious acronyms to refer to each different
type, as shown in Table~\ref{table:HoneypotTypes}.

This paper focuses on \textbf{L}ow-\textbf{I}nteraction-\textbf{H}igh-\textbf{V}olume
(\texttt{LIHV}) and \textbf{H}igh-\textbf{I}nteraction-\textbf{L}ow-\textbf{V}olume
(\texttt{HILV}) honeypots.  The other two types of honeypot are less
interesting, for different reasons. On the one hand, a
\textbf{L}ow-\textbf{I}nteraction-\textbf{L}ow-\textbf{V}olume (\texttt{LILV}) honeypot
has limited utility. If required, its functionality can be provided by an
\texttt{HILV} honeypot, at no significant extra cost. For example, an exercise
in installing and testing a tool such as \texttt{Kippo}~\cite{SH:15} can be
undertaken with an \texttt{HILV} honeypot just as easily as with an
\texttt{LILV} honeypot.  On the other hand, a
\textbf{H}igh-\textbf{I}nteraction-\textbf{H}igh-\textbf{V}olume (\texttt{HIHV})
honeypot is expensive to deploy and time-consuming to reconfigure for different
teaching scenarios. This type of honeypot is useful in a research environment,
e.g. for use in long term Internet-based projects, but is not required for
teaching a full range of practical cybersecurity skills at undergraduate level.

The main finding of this paper is that a stimulating environment for teaching
practical, real-world cybersecurity skills, in a university setting, can be
provided in a safe, cost-effective manner using a combination of a flexible,
general purpose, network laboratory together with the sandboxed deployment of
\texttt{LIHV} and \texttt{HILV} honeypots.

The paper is structured as follows: Section~\ref{sec:RelatedWork} discusses
current research in approaches to teaching practical aspects of cybersecurity.
Section~\ref{sec:TeachingRequire} outlines the requirements of a flexible
laboratory environment for teaching networking and cybersecurity.
Section~\ref{sec:HoneyArch} classifies honeypot architectures and discusses the
two that we have found most useful for the teaching of networking and
cybersecurity.  Section~\ref{sec:netlab} describes the design and
implementation of a general purpose networking laboratory, suitable
for the safe deployment of honeypots.  Section~\ref{sec:Results} discusses how
the flexible laboratory environment has been used at Northumbria University for
teaching networking and cybersecurity.  Section~\ref{sec:ConclusionFuture}
concludes and proposes further work for the development and application of the
laboratory for teaching and research.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:RelatedWork}
There are many papers relating to the development and use of honeypot
technologies. These papers cover both physical and virtual implementations, and
their application to teaching cybersecurity. 

Romney and Lanoy~\cite{LR:06}, Hiber et al.~\cite{HRS:08}, Wannous and
Nakano~\cite{WN:10} and Marsa et al.~\cite{MGDL:13} discuss the use of a
variety of virtual environments for the deployment of laboratory/honeypot
platforms and networking architectures. In our experience, virtualisation works
well for network simulation but limits the range of practical cybersecurity
activities that can be undertaken. The limitations extend to deployment,
resource utilisation, and data capture. The main problems arise because the
resources in a virtual environment are shared. For example, if multiple
experiments are performed simultaneously in a laboratory based on \texttt{VLAN}
technology, unexpected results may be observed due to cross boundary effects.
We have seen a MAC flood experiment running on one VLAN cause unexpected packet
loss in another experiment running at the same time on another VLAN. This can
be caused by exhaustion of a resource shared by VLANs using the same switch,
e.g. the switch's MAC table or backplane. This issue should cause concern to
anyone considering performing cybersecurity experiments on a VLAN connected to
their main university campus network.

Experiments in a virtual environment may breach a sandboxed virtual host, so
impacting on other experiments. The physical networking components of a virtual
server are often shared across the virtual hosts even though the hosts use
virtualised addresses. Again, this can produce unexpected results when
experiments are executed simultaneously. When conducting remote attack
experiments, the network capture capabilities are also complicated by
virtualisation, due to the mixture of traffic from multiple experiments. For
example, a simple reconnaissance scan of a network can compromise other
experiments.

Although it is often possible to propose a solution to any particular problem
caused by the sharing of resources, it is very difficult to be confident that
one has considered all such problems that may arise when using a virtual
environment. Having said that, we do often use virtualisation to add resources
to our physical architecture, but only in circumstances where the sharing of
the virtualised resources can be carefully controlled.

Abler et al.~\cite{ACG:06} describe a more independent, hardware-based
environment for cybersecurity experiments, but their environment still relies
on \texttt{VLAN} technologies and requires a large number of routers, switches
and servers. Their environment is configurable but it seems that experiments
involving attacks on network infrastructure could cause problems for multiple,
simultaneous users.

Salah et al.~\cite{SHZ:15} propose the use of cloud services such as Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for the deployment of configurable environments for
cybersecurity. However many of the issues relating to virtualisation are
reflected in this approach. In addition, the usage agreements for the EC2
platform places restrictions on what can be done in this environment. Section 6
of the Customer Agreement states that the service could be suspended if
\textit{``\ldots your or an End User's use of the Service Offerings (i) poses a
security risk to the Service Offerings or any third party, (ii) could adversely
impact our systems, the Service Offerings or the systems or Content of any
other AWS customer''}~\cite{AWS:18}.

Lee et al.~\cite{LUFC:11} discuss an approach based on a simple physical
\texttt{LAN}, with multiple clients and servers located on a subnet.  Their
environment is very popular for cybersecurity competitions in which teams can
compete in activities such as capture-the-flag or time trials. The environment
provides limited access to network traffic, which compromises its effectiveness
as a tool for the analysis of specific attacks, but it does provide users with a
platform for trying out attacks, usually using well established tool-sets, such
as those provided by \texttt{Kali Linux}~\cite{OS:17}. This type of platform
works well for events such as those organised by the Cyber Security Challenge
UK organisation~\cite{CSCUK:18} where cybersecurity is treated as a competitive
activity rather than a topic for detailed investigation.  

The low cost of the \texttt{HILV} honeypots described in this paper enable us
to extend the multi-honeypot experimental environments discussed by
Duffany~\cite{JD:08}, since it becomes affordable to increase the number of
available honeypots for distributed data capture. Our \texttt{HILV} design also
produces a honeypot that is small enough to be portable, and therefore easily
deployed in different locations, not only the laboratory but even a student's
home environment.

In comparison with other approaches, we have found that the integration of
\texttt{HILV} honeypots with an \texttt{LIHV} honeypot in a dedicated network
laboratory gives a highly configurable, cost-effective, safe environment for
running many different networking and cybersecurity projects and activities.
For example, our environment is capable of investigating all of the
attack techniques discussed by Spitner~\cite{LS:03}, as well as many others.



\section{Laboratory Requirements}\label{sec:TeachingRequire}

This section discusses the main requirements of the honeypot technologies and
the general purpose network laboratory for the delivery of networking and
cybersecurity modules. The teaching environment consists of three distinct
components: the small scale \texttt{HILV} honeypots (\textit{requirements
1,2,3,4,5}), the \texttt{LIHV} honeypot (\textit{requirement 6}), and the
general purpose networking laboratory (\textit{requirements 7,8}).

\subsection{\texttt{HILV} Honeypot}\label{subsec:ResearchHoneypot}

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Requirement 1}}:
The \texttt{HILV} honeypot must allow students: to deploy basic networking services
on multiple low-cost servers
(e.g.\ \texttt{DHCP}/\texttt{DNS}/\texttt{HTTP}/\texttt{DB}); to attack these
services; and to capture and analyse the details of the network traffic
and server events that are generated.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Requirement 2}}:
In order to satisfy Requirement 1, while protecting the rest of the laboratory
from the effects of attacks, there needs to be a mechanism that allows students
to connect their servers to the general networking laboratory via port mapping
or address forwarding.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Requirement 3}}:
The servers need to have limited hardware resources in order to allow the
analysis of resource exhaustion attacks without requiring a large number of
attacking end points, e.g.\ it should be possible to launch a successful
resource exhaustion attack from a botnet consisting of a few machines rather
than hundreds or thousands.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Requirement 4}}:
The honeypot must provide scope for additional services and devices to be
added. It must also provide the ability to cascade multiple honeypots to create
a honeynet~\cite{AA:15,FDF:15,KNC:15}.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Requirement 5}}:
The honeypot must facilitate effective network traffic capture to ensure the
integrity of any network analysis e.g.\ identifying network transactions in a
website defacement or denial of service (\texttt{DoS} or \texttt{DDoS})
attack, or spoofed packets in \texttt{ARP} poisoning for
man-in-the-middle (\texttt{MitM}) attacks~\cite{PS:16,RSKA:16}.

\subsection{\texttt{LIHV} Honeypot}\label{subsec:LabHoneypot}

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Requirement 6}}:
There needs to be a facility that allows large numbers of students to test
existing cybersecurity tools and to provide them with the ability to develop
and test their own tools.

\subsection{General Networking Laboratory}\label{subsec:GeneralLab}

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Requirement 7}}: There must be a flexible,
reconfigurable, base laboratory environment, isolated from the main university
campus network, for students to carry out their normal studies of networks,
operating systems and network services. Students require administrative access
to the basic networking equipment such as routers, switches, and desktop
machines for installation and configuration of general purpose tools and
virtual environments. These activities would normally be prohibited on a
university campus network~\cite{MGDL:13}. This is the case at Northumbria
University, although limited access is provided to staff rooms via campus
\texttt{VLAN} connections. However, these connections are to be phased out 
in~2018. There also needs to be a facility to deploy a standard software
environment to all devices with minimal administrative intervention.  

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Requirement 8}}: The laboratory network should
implement a security policy, independent of the standard university policy,
controlling access to the Internet. This is to allow students to access
security sites and relevant software packages. Many academic networks block
access to cybersecurity tool sites from their specialist and general access
laboratories~\cite{ACGO:06,YYLCHJ:04}, as well as from the open access areas
used by students. Tools such a \texttt{Metasploit}~\cite{R7:17} or the
\texttt{Kali Linux} distribution~\cite{OS:17} are usually blocked, as are
cybersecurity information sites such as \texttt{http://www.hak5.org} or
\texttt{https://www.exploit-db.com/}. It must be possible to lift these
restrictions in a laboratory supporting cybersecurity studies.

\section{Honeypot Architectures}\label{sec:HoneyArch}

As shown in Table~\ref{table:HoneypotTypes}, we consider four types 
of honeypot architecture.

\begin{itemize}

  \item \noindent \textit{\textbf{LILV}} This type of honeypot is used when a
    basic testing platform is required to identify how a service is being
    attacked but no other interactions need to be investigated. For example, a
    software system, such as \texttt{Kippo}~\cite{SH:15}, can be studied to
    discover how it logs transactions to a file or a database. 

  \item \noindent \textit{\textbf{LIHV}} This type of honeypot is used when
    carrying out analysis of a high volume of service requests while capturing
    only a limited amount of service and system activity data, e.g.\ when
    analysing multiple concurrent authentication attacks on an
    \texttt{FTP} server by investigating only the service log files. This type of
    honeypot can also be used in a general purpose networking laboratory with
    students to allow them to investigate authentication tools such as Hydra
    and xHydra~\cite{RS:15} and to be a target when they are developing their
    own tools such as an authentication-based botnet.

  \item \noindent \textit{\textbf{HILV}} This type of honeypot is used when there
    is a low volume of service requests but fine-grained data capture is
    required. For example, when investigating a \texttt{DNS} enumeration
    attack, a single \texttt{AXFR}~\cite{EL:10} query may be the only service
    request required to initiate the attack, but the effect of this query, and
    the high-level of activity it generates, can be captured in great detail.  A
    similar example is the profiling of a \texttt{Wordpress}~\cite{WP:17} site
    using \texttt{WPScan}~\cite{WT:17}.

  \item \noindent \textit{\textbf{HIHV}} This type of honeypot is used when a
    system is being thoroughly tested with a high volume of service requests
    (pressure testing) and involves large numbers of high-powered servers capable
    of supporting high levels of concurrent interactions. These honeypots
    provide detailed data capture capabilities of all the services and the
    inter-service interactions as well as system transactions e.g. \texttt{SQL}
    queries and responses. They are usually deployed as ``real'' systems for
    penetration testing and are often exposed to the Internet to analyse the
    effects of unsolicited attacks.  

\end{itemize}

The two types of honeypot deployed in the laboratory are
\texttt{HILV} and \texttt{LIHV}. These are now presented in more detail.

\subsection{\texttt{HILV} Honeypot}

The \texttt{HILV} honeypot architecture provides an isolated environment that
can be connected to the main laboratory infrastructure in a controlled way
using a commercially available cable router, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:HPOverview}.

\Figure[t!](topskip=0pt, botskip=0pt, midskip=0pt)[width=14cm]{Images/Honeypot1.pdf}

% \caption{\texttt{HILV} honeypot overview}
% \label{fig:HPOverview}
% \end{center}
% \end{figure*}

Figures~\ref{fig:HP1}~and~\ref{fig:HP2} shows the complete device as deployed
in the specialist teaching laboratories. The complete \texttt{HILV} honeypot
consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \noindent A router for traffic management to and from the laboratory
      infrastructure via \texttt{NAT} and address forwarding. (connected via the
      green cable). 
    \item \noindent 4 Raspberry Pi boards~\cite{RASP:17} for service deployment.
    \item \noindent A managed switch for packet capture:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \noindent 1 port (port 8) setup as a monitor usually connected to
          a PC running \texttt{TCPDump} or \texttt{Wireshark} (red cable).
        \item \noindent All other ports are mirrored to the monitor (ports
          1--7).
        \item \noindent 1 port (port 7) links the switch and router.
        \item \noindent 4 ports (ports 1--4) are connected to the 4 Raspberry Pi 
        servers.
        \item \noindent 2 spare ports (ports 5,6) are available for additional
          services, clients, or devices to be added (blue cables).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The two additional devices shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPOverview} could be PCs
acting as attack entry points or victims. These devices could also be PCs
supporting virtualisation to extend the honeypot's functionality.

The use of Raspberry Pi boards as the main servers for the honeypot simplifies
reconfiguration and rebuilding of the architecture.  The operating system (and
configured services) are stored on removable media (micro \texttt{SD} cards) which
simplifies server recovery and the maintenance of multiple configurations.
Images of the honeypot's base configuration can easily be restored. Multiple
configurations can be kept on different image sets and students can keep
individual projects as a set of micro \texttt{SD} cards that they retain for the
duration of a project.

The approximate cost of the basic \texttt{HILV} honeypot, without additional
devices or the monitoring PC attached, is $\approx$\pounds300 a breakdown of
the costs is shown in Table~\ref{table:HILVCosts}. This offers a highly
stimulating environment for the teaching of practical cybersecurity skills at a
very low cost.

  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \end{table}

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Address Range Support}}:
The \texttt{HILV} honeypot environment must reside on a different subnet from
the main laboratory network in order for the double \texttt{NAT}'d
configuration to function correctly. This is achieved by assigning a private
class~A \texttt{IP} address block, providing more than 16 million addresses.
\newline

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Router Configuration}}:
The \texttt{HILV} honeypot's \texttt{ADSL} router is configured to provide only
routing services by disabling all other services, e.g.\ \texttt{NAS} and
\texttt{DHCP} facilities. This configuration allows all infrastructure
protocols to be managed from within the honeypot using small-scale servers
(Raspberry Pi boards). Configuring the services on separate
servers allows analysis of inter-service activity during normal network
activity and during an attack.

A low-cost router such as a \texttt{TP Link TL-R470T+}~\cite{TPLINKR470:18} is
adequate for use in the \texttt{HILV} honeypot. The router is configured to use
the laboratory-based \texttt{DHCP} server to acquire an  address. The
\texttt{IP} address is allocated from a reservation which allows a consistent
mapping of the forwarded \texttt{IP} address from the Internet-based router to
the \texttt{HILV} honeypot router. Defining the mapping in this way allows
external host names (\texttt{URL}s) to be mapped to the honeypot for
Internet-based attack analysis. Forwarding of traffic from the router into the
honeypot can be enabled and disabled when required.

For direct access to the honeypot from the laboratory, \texttt{IP} forwarding is
configured to  ``point'' to a target machine within the honeypot,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Forward}. In small-scale routers, this operation is
normally referred to as a \texttt{DMZ} (demilitarised zone) redirection~\cite{MB:01}.

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Switch Configuration}}:
A key component of the \texttt{HILV} honeypot is a commercially available,
8-port, managed switch. The switch supports layer 2 management~\cite{ST:98} to
provide two specific technologies: port mirroring and port throttling. Suitable
switches include \texttt{HP 2530-08}~\cite{HP:17}, \texttt{TP-LINK
TL-SG2008}~\cite{TP:17}, and \texttt{TP Link TL-SG108E}~\cite{TPSG108E:18}.  The
combination of port mirroring and port throttling provides a reliable
architecture for packet capture.  \newline

\noindent\textit{Port mirroring}: Switches maintain an in-memory table of ports
and \texttt{MAC} addresses to support the efficient delivery of frames. This
ensures that packets are transferred port to port rather than being broadcast
(port to port communications are known as ``virtual circuits''). This technology
complicates the process of packet capture. When using a honeypot, packet
capture is a vital part of the architecture for the analysis of any
network-based attack vector. Using a managed switch (as discussed above), it is
possible to configure the ports on the switch to be mirrored to a specific
port, as shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:HPOverview} and~\ref{fig:throttling}. This
allows all the network activity to be captured and analysed~(\textit{Requirement
8}). Switches can implement mirroring in one of two ways. Firstly, a
monitor-only port can be provided, where the transmission capability of the
port is removed, (as in the case of an \texttt{HP 1810-G}). This type of
configuration prevents the monitoring device from adding traffic to the
network. Alternatively, some manufacturers configure the mirroring port to
offer full transmit/receive functionality, in addition to the mirroring
capability (as in the case of a \texttt{TP-SG108E}). This allows the attached
monitor to also be used as a device within the honeypot. If the monitor port
provides full functionality, the addition of a \texttt{LAN} tap~\cite{RB:13}
can remove the transmission facilities of the port, creating monitor-only
functionality when required, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPOverview}.
\newline

\noindent\textit{Bandwidth throttling:} A further issue with the capture of the
honeypot network traffic is the possibility of frame loss on the port to which
the mirrored traffic is forwarded.  Switches are designed to provide maximum
transfer speed between ports. This is achieved through the switch's backplane.
If the throughput of traffic on the mirrored ports exceeds the bandwidth of the
port to which the traffic is mirrored, then frame loss at this port is
inevitable. To prevent this occurring, the switch must be configured to throttle
the throughput on the mirrored ports so as not to overwhelm the backplane.
Figure~\ref{fig:throttling} shows the basic configuration of a throttled
environment. The port which has the frames forwarded to it must be configured
to run at a speed that exceeds the total bandwidth of the mirrored ports. The
effect of this is that as frames are transferred between ports, they are
reliably replicated via the backplane to the monitor port. This configuration
satisfies requirement 8.

% \end{figure}

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Internet Support}}:
Access to the Internet from the honeypot is possible through the double
\texttt{NAT}'d configuration. This configuration provides isolation from the
laboratory and the Internet. External response to a service request from a
device in the honeypot is achieved through packet forwarding, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Forward}. For this technique to function correctly the laboratory
network and honeypot network must be on different subnets.

The Internet facility also supports \texttt{IP} address forwarding to allow
Internet-based access into the honeypot. From the Internet, packets are
forwarded to the address of a honeypot router which, in turn, forwards traffic
to a target machine inside the honeypot, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Forward}.

This configuration allows specific configurations to be exposed in order to
capture Internet-based attacks and to support remote access to the honeypot for
remote configuration and monitoring.

\subsection{\texttt{LIHV} Honeypot}

The \texttt{LIHV} honeypot is not intended for use in a reconfigurable
environment and does not require any monitoring or control of the network. No
port monitoring or throttling is required and all activity monitoring is
achieved using log files. The log files are made available 
for analysis of service-based access activity via a web-link.

The \texttt{LIHV} honeypot is a single 1U \texttt{LAMP} server (\texttt{HPE
ProLiant DL360 Gen9 Server}~\cite{HPE:17} costing approx \pounds2000), located
in a separate cabinet, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Overview2}. The cabinet is
secured to prevent students having direct access to the hardware. It supports
the general honeypot service to provide students with a platform to carry out
simple authentication attacks using tools such as \texttt{Hydra} from within
the \texttt{Kali Linux}~\cite{OS:17} toolset. This honeypot also provides a
target for the development of bespoke authentication attack tools in the final
year undergraduate cybersecurity modules.  This server is accessed directly in
the laboratory, or via the Internet, as a bastion server~\cite{MB:05}. This
allows access from within the laboratory, but also from outside the laboratory
to support directed learning tasks and also to support collaborative ventures.

\section{General Networking Laboratory}\label{sec:netlab}
\subsection{Overview}
The flexible laboratory environment comprises a secured communications cabinet,
several open-access, teaching cabinets, and benches with desktop PCs for
student use. The physical networking layer between devices is reconfigurable.
This is achieved by the use of a structured cabling
architecture~(Fig.~\ref{fig:Overview1}).  Internet access is provided by
cascading each cabinet's ``internet switch'' to the central communication
cabinet's ``internet switch''. A logical view of the internet facilities is
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:NetworkLogical}.

% \end{figure}

The communications cabinet is secured; students are not allowed access to it,
in order to prevent them from reconfiguring the base network and the network
services equipment. Figure~\ref{fig:CommsCabinet} shows the main infrastructure
cabling within the communications cabinet.  The cabinet also contains the
primary \texttt{DHCP} and \texttt{DNS} servers, a 1U intranet server, a
database server and a \texttt{NAS} drive as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:CommsCabinetServers}. It also includes a \texttt{VDSL} fibre link
from the \texttt{ISP}. In the case of Northumbria University, the provider is
BT Business~\cite{BT:17}. A \texttt{Draytek Vigor 2850}~\cite{DC:17} router is
used to manage the \texttt{ISP} connection.

%     \caption{Communications cabinet servers\label{fig:CommsCabinetServers}}
%   \end{minipage}
% \end{figure}

Students have unrestricted access to the other cabinets, each of which is
linked to a laboratory bench supporting 8--10 students, These cabinets contain
a selection of switches, routers, \texttt{IP} telephony, \texttt{IDS}, and
firewall equipment that is required for general computer networking modules, as
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Cabinet}.  They are linked back to the communications
cabinet to provide internet access for the benches. Access to the internet from
the desktop is achieved through a \texttt{NAT} connection from the \texttt{ISP}
router in the communications cabinet.  The structured cabling allows the
resources of each cabinet within the laboratory to be linked to the desktop
through structured cabling ports.  Cross-cabinet connections ensure specialist
resources are flexibly available to all benches e.g.\ switches, routers,
firewalls, and \texttt{IDS} (Intrusion Detection Systems) etc.

\subsection{Address Range Support}

The use of virtualisation at the desktop (\texttt{GNS3}~\cite{GNS3:17},
\texttt{VMWare}~\cite{VMWARE:17} and \texttt{VirtualBox}~\cite{O:17}), to
support operating systems and networking modules, requires enough
host addresses to support a large number of students deploying statically
addressed virtual hosts. The base laboratory network infrastructure is
configured as a single class B subnet.  This provides 65,534 addresses, which
is more than enough for each student to be allocated a block of contiguous
\texttt{IP} addresses for each module, allowing multiple modules to be
delivered concurrently without having \texttt{IP} address conflicts.  This
approach also allows equipment to be moved around in the laboratory without
requiring address reconfiguration.

\subsection{Network Service Deployment}\label{InfraService}

To support the study of operating systems and other general computing subjects,
the network requires, as a minimum, \texttt{DNS}~\cite{RA:11} and
\texttt{DHCP}~\cite{DL:02} services. These services are deployed across three
small-scale, 1U servers (\texttt{HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen9
Server}~\cite{HPE:17}). Two servers are located in the communications cabinet
as shown in~Fig.~\ref{fig:Overview1}. One server supports \texttt{DHCP} and
\texttt{DNS}, which are integrated to create a \texttt{DDNS}~\cite{SV:06}
environment. The second server acts as the secondary \texttt{DNS} server. The
third server is located in the \texttt{LIHV} honeypot cabinet and acts as a
further secondary \texttt{DNS} server.  The communications cabinet also
contains a 1U server that provides the laboratory intranet (\texttt{LAMP}
based) service, along with general purpose \texttt{MySQL} database services for
the intranet and module content delivery.

Deployment of known desktop equipment is coordinated by creating reservation
entries in the \texttt{DHCP} service. The \texttt{DHCP} server then
automatically creates the forward and reverse \texttt{DNS} entries in the
\texttt{DNS} architecture as the equipment boots. Students can also connect
their own devices which are allocated a network configuration from a
\texttt{DHCP} address pool.

\subsection{Teaching Facilities Support}

Teaching of standard technologies, such as switching and routing, use the
physical equipment within the cabinets. The laboratory also supports network
virtualisation through \texttt{GNS3}, which can be integrated with the physical
equipment when necessary. The teaching of the \texttt{OS}-based technologies is
supported through the use of desktop virtualisation, allowing each student to
have multiple clients and servers running simultaneously on a single machine.
For large-scale scenarios, which are required on some modules, the virtual
machines may be deployed across several desktop machines. These large scale
deployments require the virtualisation software to support network card
bridging to allow the virtual machines to be ``physically'' connected to the
laboratory infrastructure.  Subjects that require a laboratory
``search-by-name'' facility (\texttt{DNS} and \texttt{rDNS}) such as Java
sockets and C sockets programming are supported by the \texttt{DDNS}
implementation as discussed in~Sect.~\ref{InfraService}.

\section{Experience of laboratory use in teaching}\label{sec:Results}

The general laboratory infrastructure has been in place, and actively used, for
10 years. The \texttt{LIHV} honeypot has been in place for 9 years. The
honeypot was developed to support a cybersecurity module on an undergraduate
networking programme and has been used successfully in the teaching of basic
attack vectors such as port analysis, banner grabbing and service interaction
(\texttt{FTP} and \texttt{HTTP}) both for taught modules and student projects.

The \texttt{HILV} honeypots were designed and built 6 years ago and have been
used since 2012 (5 years) on undergraduate networking and cybersecurity
programmes. They have been deployed in activities such as service redirection
attacks, amplification attacks and man-in-the-middle scenarios.  The use of
Raspberry Pi boards in the \texttt{HILV} honeypots has allowed diverse subjects
to be taught more easily due to their use of removable media to store the
operating system. The setup time for laboratories and teaching sessions has
been significantly reduced, in comparison with our previous approach of using
small clusters of PC's with removable drives. This is reflected in the
students' response to the configuration of the \texttt{HILV} honeypot, as
discussed in section~\ref{sec:Feedback}.  There have been several hardware
changes to the \texttt{HILV} honeypots over this time but the basic
architecture has remained unchanged. The latest change involved an upgrade from
Raspberry Pi 2 to Raspberry Pi 3. The cost of layer 2 switches and their
availability has also improved and they are now more affordable. As new
honeypots are fabricated, \texttt{TP-LINK} switches are being used in
preference to the more expensive HP switches. The \texttt{TP-LINK} switches do
not provide a fully implemented monitor port; this requires the inclusion of a
network tap as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPOverview}.

\subsection{Supported Teaching\label{ResourceSupport}}

The current implementation of the laboratory supports \textgreater200 students. This
includes undergraduates studying networking ($\approx$40) and cybersecurity
($\approx$150), and postgraduates studying networking ($\approx$20). Each of our
programmes is delivered in modules. A typical undergraduate programme runs
around 10 modules concurrently e.g.\ networking technology (years 1, 2, 3 \&
4 with MComp), security case projects (Year 2), sockets programming (year 3).
Each module requires $\approx$3~hours contact per week and $\approx$3~hours of
directed learning, which may require laboratory time.  In addition, the
laboratory supports many undergraduate and postgraduate cybersecurity projects
($\approx$80), including cyber attack analysis and general cybersecurity research
such as biometric-based, multi-factor authentication and \texttt{IoT} (Internet
of Things) security projects.

\subsection{Supported Modules\label{Modules}}

All network engineering modules, across both undergraduate and postgraduate
programmes, involving routing, switching, \texttt{VLAN} deployment,
\texttt{MPLS} networking and \texttt{IP} telephony are successfully taught
using the general networking laboratory infrastructure.

Network service deployment, using server operating systems (Windows and Linux),
for both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, is taught successfully in
the environment using virtual machine technologies. The network service
deployments include load-balanced \texttt{HTTP}, network file system
deployments (\texttt{NFS} and \texttt{SMB}), replication based \texttt{MySQL}
services and large scale \texttt{DNS} deployments.

The \texttt{HILV} honeypot environment has allowed aspects of network-based
infrastructure, specifically broadcast network services, to be taught as
a practical implementation rather than only as a simulation, and has allowed
students to develop complete network infrastructures integrated to the
Internet.

Cybersecurity modules are predominantly taught using the \texttt{HILV}
honeypots, particularly when looking at attack vectors that require packet
spoofing or resource exhaustion through the volume of traffic generation.

The \texttt{HILV} honeypots have also allowed analysis of live attacks from the
Internet without impacting on the local laboratory network. Activities such as
port scanning are passed through directly to the \texttt{HILV} honeypot, without
exposing the laboratory infrastructure. The use of multiple \texttt{HILV}
honeypots has allowed profiles of subnet scanning and attacks to be analysed by
students, providing them with a rich environment for experimentation and
analysis.

\subsection{Supported Projects\label{Projects}}
The \texttt{HILV} honeypots have been available for several years now and
students who move to the final year of the cybersecurity undergraduate
programme tend to carry out research-based projects. Usually these involve the
use of the basic \texttt{HILV} honeypot, but some projects add additional
components to the honeypot such as firewalls (pfSense~\cite{PFSENSE:18} or
ipFire~\cite{IPFIRE:18}) or wireless access points for the analysis of smartphone or
tablet-based application attacks. A sample of recent projects is described below.

\begin{itemize} 
  \item \noindent \textit{Multi-Tiered defence analysis of a simulated cyber
    attack.} This project involved configuring the \texttt{HILV} honeypots to
    support an \texttt{IPFire} (software based firewall technology), and
    investigating potential tunnelling techniques that could compromise a
    military grade network.  
  \item \noindent \textit{Development of a small \texttt{IDS}.} This project
    involved developing a \texttt{libpcap-}based application to run on one of the
    Raspberry Pi boards. The application monitored network
    traffic to identify a \texttt{SYN} flood attack using a simple window-based
    statistical analysis.  
    \item \noindent \textit{Attack on a secure \texttt{IoT} protocol.} This
      project involved developing a network of \texttt{IoT} devices for
      environment analysis (temperature and humidity), and identifying the
      encrypted payloads within the traffic (\texttt{MQTT}), which were then
      attacked using a block decryption technique.
    \item \noindent \textit{Development of an \texttt{IDS} for a full subnet
      \texttt{MitM} attack.} This project involved developing a stateful 
      \texttt{IDS} using \texttt{libpcap} to identify spoofed \texttt{ARP} packets.  
    \item \noindent \textit{Development of a \texttt{DOS} tool that attempts to
      prevent detection from an \texttt{IDS}.} This project involved developing
      a \texttt{RAW} sockets application that crafted packets to
      replicate valid traffic within the subnet environment.  
     \item \noindent \textit{Analysis of a \texttt{DNS} amplification attack.} This
       project involved configuring a vulnerable \texttt{DNS} environment,
       executing an attack, and analysing the bandwidth effect on the network.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Student Feedback}\label{sec:Feedback}
In academic year 2017/18, following the delivery of the security case project,
we carried out an online, five-point, Likert-type scale survey to gauge student
opinion about the effectiveness of the laboratory configurations. We canvassed
a cohort of 48 students of whom 29 responded. The results of the survey are
discussed briefly below.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \noindent\textit{Utility:} Students were asked how useful they found the
\texttt{HILV} honeypot for the practical research component of the module. All
students found the honeypot useful, with 89.66\% rating the usefulness as very
good or excellent. This result matched our expectations, as students usually
report that they learn better when they have access to physical equipment. 
  \item \noindent\textit{Ease of use:} Students were asked how easy it was to
configure the \texttt{HILV} honeypot. This question related to scenarios in
which students were provided with a basic configuration and were required to
extend and adapt it to their own requirements. 98\% of students reported that
it was not difficult to configure the honeypot, with the majority indicating
that they found it easy or very easy. 
\par\noindent This ease of use can be attributed to the following factors.
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item The base configuration of the honeypot has a fixed configuration for
      its router and switch. This allows students to sign out any of the
      honeypots from the loans facility and use it immediately in a
      `plug-and-play' fashion for many exercises.  
    \item The students created their own base servers from a set of images
      distributed from the laboratory \texttt{NAS} drive.  Following each
      practical session, the students retained the \texttt{SD} cards for use at
      the next session. The \texttt{SD} cards provided a stateful configuration
      of their work.  
    \item The students were able to backup their entire project using a ``dump''
      (\texttt{dd}) of the \texttt{SD} cards.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \noindent\textit{Previous experience and likely future use}: Students
were asked if they had used a honeypot earlier in their studies. Most students
(93\%, 27/29) had not used a honeypot before their undergraduate studies and
therefore had no preconception of what to expect. In contrast, when asked if
they would consider using the \texttt{HILV} honeypot again, the majority
(97\%, 28/29) of the students indicated that they would use it for further studies. 
\end{itemize}
More extensive and more careful studies are needed to quantify the 
pedagogical benefits of our approach but these preliminary results are an 
indication of a very positive student reaction to their experience in our
laboratory.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:ConclusionFuture}

The development of the \texttt{HILV} honeypot environment, and its integration
with the general purpose networks lab and the \texttt{LIHV} laboratory-based
honeypot, has proved successful for both teaching and research. The cost of the
\texttt{HILV} honeypot has been reduced to such an extent that, rather than the
laboratory supporting a single (\texttt{LIHV}) honeypot, which has to be
reconfigured between sessions, the laboratory can now support multiple
honeypots that are highly configurable and portable.

As the \texttt{HILV} honeypots are small-scale and low-cost, the equipment is
permanently configured for teaching purposes. Each \texttt{HILV} honeypot is
capable of supporting four students at a time to work on research-based modules
and allows practical cybersecurity modules to be delivered more effectively.

The integration of the honeypots into a laboratory environment that supports
a wide-range of other technology-focused modules provides a cost-effective
solution to the delivery of stimulating, practical cybersecurity teaching.

Student numbers have risen sharply for cybersecurity courses and the
use of the honeypots has allowed additional levels of cybersecurity to be
incorporated into existing network courses. This has had a strategic impact on
the University since the B.C.S. (British Computing Society) added
cybersecurity as a required part of its accreditation process.

Our aim is to increase the number of \texttt{HILV} honeypots to accommodate the
increasing number of students. The low cost of the platform makes this an
achievable goal. It is also envisaged that, using this technology, the
department will be able to expand its cybersecurity research by preparing
students for PhD studies in the subject area. It is intended to seek funding to
develop a \texttt{HIHV} honeypot to support these PhD students. This honeypot
will consist of several large scale servers along with commercial grade
switches and routers and large-scale data capture facilities. Such a facility
will provide an excellent environment for the study of cybersecurity at PhD
level and has the potential to advance our understanding of the subject
significantly.
